Good afternoon, everyone.  I'm excited to share with you my project on designing a user-centric cryptocurrency exchange platform.
from designer i was not able to get more information is because i didn't find anyone 

 For this project, I aimed to bridge the gap between user expectations in the crypto exchange market and the expertise of designers. 
so when i asked them about apps and website they said app is more relvent but why are they not able ti use it is because they need to see big graph
i also want to make it usable for blind people by giving prompts, so for that i need to think more about about it 
 
My research highlighted the preference for mobile devices due to the need for daily updates, which led us to choose a mobile app over a website. Security emerged as a top priority, with users expressing the importance of features like two-factor authentication and cold storage. Notifications, educational resources, and social trading were also key considerations.


platform that not only meets the functional needs of users but also exceeds their expectations in terms of usability, security, and innovation
